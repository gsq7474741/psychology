打分分数按评分者取平均后在该列上划分为三类，大于均值+标准差的，小于均值-标准差的，介于二者之间的。

5个指标均进行了以上处理，并在现阶段效果最好的13个机器学习模型上进行了训练。

不同模型的效果保存在了leaderboard.csv中，其中各个字段含义如下:

Output summary of information about models produced during fit() as a `pd.DataFrame`. Includes information on test and validation scores for all models, model training times, inference times, and stack levels. Output DataFrame columns include:

- **‘model’: The name of the model.**
- ‘score_val’: The validation score of the model on the ‘eval_metric’.
	- NOTE: Metrics scores always show in higher is better form. This means that metrics such as log_loss and root_mean_squared_error will have their signs FLIPPED, and values will be negative. This is necessary to avoid the user needing to know the metric to understand if higher is better when looking at leaderboard.
- **‘pred_time_val’: The inference time required to compute predictions on the validation data end-to-end.**
	- Equivalent to the sum of all ‘pred_time_val_marginal’ values for the model and all of its base models.
- **‘fit_time’: The fit time required to train the model end-to-end (Including base models if the model is a stack ensemble).**
	- Equivalent to the sum of all ‘fit_time_marginal’ values for the model and all of its base models.
- **‘pred_time_val_marginal’: The inference time required to compute predictions on the validation data (Ignoring inference times for base models).**
	- Note that this ignores the time required to load the model into memory when bagging is disabled.
- **‘fit_time_marginal’: The fit time required to train the model (Ignoring base models). ‘stack_level’: The stack level of the model.**
	- A model with stack level N can take any set of models with stack level less than N as input, with stack level 1 models having no model inputs.
 - **‘can_infer’: If model is able to perform inference on new data. If False, then the model either was not saved, was deleted, or an ancestor of the model cannot infer.**


每个特征对每个指标的重要性也进行了测试，结果保存在feature_importance.csv中，测试说明如下

Calculates feature importance scores for the given model via permutation importance. Refer to [https://explained.ai/rf-importance/](https://explained.ai/rf-importance/) for an explanation of permutation importance. A feature’s importance score represents the performance drop that results when the model makes predictions on a perturbed copy of the data where this feature’s values have been randomly shuffled across rows. A feature score of 0.01 would indicate that the predictive performance dropped by 0.01 when the feature was randomly shuffled. The higher the score a feature has, the more important it is to the model’s performance. If a feature has a negative score, this means that the feature is likely harmful to the final model, and a model trained with the feature removed would be expected to achieve a better predictive performance.

结果字段含义如下：

feature_importance.csv scores with 6 columns:

- **index: The feature name.** 
- **‘importance’: The estimated feature importance score.** 
- **‘stddev’: The standard deviation of the feature importance score. If NaN, then not enough num_shuffle_sets were used to calculate a variance.** 
- **‘p_value’: P-value for a statistical t-test of the null hypothesis: importance = 0, vs the (one-sided) alternative: importance > 0.**
	- Features with low p-value appear confidently useful to the predictor, while the other features may be useless to the predictor (or even harmful to include in its training data). A p-value of 0.01 indicates that there is a 1% chance that the feature is useless or harmful, and a 99% chance that the feature is useful. A p-value of 0.99 indicates that there is a 99% chance that the feature is useless or harmful, and a 1% chance that the feature is useful.
- **‘n’: The number of shuffles performed to estimate importance score (corresponds to sample-size used to determine confidence interval for true score).** 
- **‘pXX_high’: Upper end of XX% confidence interval for true feature importance score (where XX=99 by default).** 
- **‘pXX_low’: Lower end of XX% confidence interval for true feature importance score.**
